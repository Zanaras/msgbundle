Messaging Bundle
================

This is a bundle for in-app messaging services using Symfony2 and (at the moment) Doctrine 2.


Features
--------
* Personal messages and forum-like broadcasts in the same system
* Threaded messages, grouped into conversations and topics
* Replies and split-replies (reply and start a new topic)
* Two-way references between messages
* Flags and tags


Vision
------
Basically, this is messaging as I believe it should be. The main purpose is that it should be:
* intuitive
* powerful
* personal


Documentation
-------------
Installation and usage instructions can be found in the [manual](Manual.md).


Current Status
--------------
This is currently somewhat closely coupled to the game it is being made for, [Might & Fealty](http://mightandfealty.com/). However, I am trying to
isolate those dependencies and it very much is intended to be a general-purpose tool. Any help moving it into that direction would be very much
appreciated.
